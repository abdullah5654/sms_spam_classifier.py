# sms_spam_classifier.py
üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for text classification. The program takes raw text data, cleans and preprocesses it, converts it into numerical features using TF-IDF, and trains a machine learning model to classify text.

The example implementation uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset to build a spam detection system.

üéØ Objectives

Clean and preprocess text data

Convert text into numerical features

Train a classification model

Evaluate the model using standard metrics

Interpret model results with word importance

Feature Engineering

Uses TF-IDF Vectorization with a maximum of 5000 features

Model Training

Logistic Regression classifier
